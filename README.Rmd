FunChIP is a repository of tools to perform exploratory analysis of Fungal ChIP-seq data. Peak enrichment output of tools like  MACS2 and HOMER can be incorporated in annotating the peaks to its target and also visualize profiles of these target genes. Currently available functions are listed below;


- `combine_macs_homer_peaks()`
- `annotate_peaks()`
- `genelist_specific_profileplot()`
